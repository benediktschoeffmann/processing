Some Tinkering with the awesome Processing language ! https://processing.org/

## Examples

* Synth

    Use keys "awsdrftghujik" to play a tone. An 'a'-key reprents a musical A, up to G# on 'k'. 
    Octave is determined by the y-position of the mouse. 

    Clicking the mouse toggles between the different Oscillators. Mouse x-position determines Pulse Width for the Pulse Oscillator.

    Have fun!
